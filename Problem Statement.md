Team project: Akash Kumar Singh, Anuj Jha

Srm Theatre can hold 5 Movies in a time.
Hence we made a program in which we used the concept of file reading Using which the Operator of the theatre can just replace the old movies with the new ones.
Then using Typedef structure I made my own data type "MOVIE" which holds the details of the ticket.
